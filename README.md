# GAME.REV

## Browse the RAWG.io videogame database with this clone created with React.JS, and TailwindCSS.

### Features
* Browse the top games of the year, last 30 days, or upcoming next week.
* Filter games based on "platforms", "release dates", "genres", and filters like "popularity" or "average rating"
* Search for specific games via the searchbar in the GAME.REV header
* Detailed information on every game such as PC requirements, development studio, metacritic scores, screenshots, game achievements, etc...

### Features to implement
* Browse upcoming games via the game calendar tab. Will also include game filters based on what is already implemented
* Refine the search filters. For example, instead of searching for "All Playstation games", search for "PS2 games" or "Xbox 360 games"
* Develop a page specifically for browsing game platforms
* Develop a page specifically for browsing game studios/developer teams

Use `npm install` to download GAME.REV dependencies, however the API key is not included, therefore I reccommend just viewing the live app demo
